// Glory!
// We want to implement a role-playing game and started working on the dice roll functionality. 
// First, study the game code. Then take a look at the example output and information provided below.

// Standard role-playing dice, with 20 faces,
// specified in terms of minimum and maximum face value.

let d20 = {min: 1, max: 20};

function roll(die) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (die.max - die.min + 1)) + die.min;
}

// Standard target roll tossing a 20-sided die,
// with optional bonus and penalty dice.
// Used to determine whether a character wanting to perform an action
// succeeds or fails, based on whether the sum of the dice is higher
// or lower than the relevant character trait.
// (See below for examples.)
function targetRoll(characterValue) {

  let result = roll(d20);

  console.log("--> " + result);

  switch (result) {
    case 1:
      automaticFail(); // should have break;
      // break;
    case 20:
      automaticSuccess(); // should have break;
      // break;
    default:
      void (result >= characterValue ? success() : fail()); 
  }
}

function success() {
  console.log("Your character succeeds.");
}

function fail () {
  console.log("Your character fails.");
}

function automaticSuccess() {
  console.log("Your character succeeds without effort. Glory!");
}

function automaticFail() {
  console.log("Meagre attempt. Your character fails miserably.");
}

// Example character.
let myCharacter = {
  name: 'Jenkins',
  strength: 4,
  constitution: 6,
  education: 11,
  luck: 3,
  sanity: 9,
};

// Example rolls:

// Jenkins wants to break in a door with brute force,
// so he has to roll against his strength value.
targetRoll(myCharacter.strength);

// Jenkins found an ancient scroll and attempts to decipher it.
// He has to roll against his education, in order to determine
// whether he's able to read it.
targetRoll(myCharacter.education);

// When playing around with the above program, our two test rolls result in two 
// random values that produce the sample output below (because each dice roll 
// produces a random value, your output may differ). The outcome of rolling 16 looks correct, 
// but the output when we rolled values 1 and 20 doesn't make sense. For each roll, 
// only one outcome should be displayed. What is wrong with the code?

// --> 1
// Meagre attempt. Your character fails miserably.
// Your character succeeds without effort. Glory!
// Your character fails.
// --> 20
// Your character succeeds without effort. Glory!
// Your character succeeds.
// --> 16
// Your character succeeds.

// In switch statements, JavaScript executes the statement associated with the 
// first case expression that matches. Then, it will continue executing all 
// subsequent statements, until it comes across a break statement. Since we 
// did not include any break statements in our original code, when the value 
// of result is 1, all statements will be executed: automaticFail(), automaticSuccess(), 
// as well as the default statement.
