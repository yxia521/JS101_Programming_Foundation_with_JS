// Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a function called rps as follows,

// it awards the win to the first of the two fists.

// What is the result of the following call?

console.log(rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")); // "paper"

// rps(rps("paper", "rock"), "rock")
